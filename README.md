hircd - Hacky IRC Daemon
========================


About
-----

hircd is a minimal, hacky implementation of an IRC server daemon written in
Python in about 600 lines of code, including comments, etc.

It only has (sometimes basic) support for:

*   Connecting
*   Channels
*   Nicknames
*   Public/private messages

It is MISSING support for notably:

*   Server linking
*   Modes (user and channel)
*   Proper error reporting
*   Basically everything else

It is mostly useful as a testing tool or perhaps for building something like a
private proxy on. Do NOT use it in any kind of production code or anything that
will ever be connected to by the public.

Hircd is included, in modified (and better maintained) form in the
[python-irc](https://python-irc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)'s
[`irc.server`](https://python-irc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/irc.html#module-irc.server)
module.

Requirements
------------

*   Python (3.5+)
*   An IRC client
